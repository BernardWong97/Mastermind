This is a Universal Window Platform Application for my college course -> Internet & Mobile Applications Development project.

The Application is titled Mastermind.

Mastermind is a famous code-breaking board game. Player tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within 5 turns.
Each guess is made by clicking each of the 2 row of code pegs provided below.
Once placed, player provided feedback by having from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess.
A black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position.
A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.
Once feedback is provided, another guess is made.
Guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either player guesses correctly, or 5 incorrect guesses are made.
The answer peg's colors are not duplicated.
The answer of the pegs are revealed after the game has ended.

Good luck and have fun!
